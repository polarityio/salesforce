The Salesforce integration will search your Salesforce instance for email addresses that are recognized on your screen.
The integration will return any contacts and leads for the email address.  When viewing the contact or lead the integration
will also show related accounts, opportunities and tasks.

> The Salesforce integration requires Polarity Server 3.4+

## Installing the Integration

General installation instructions for integrations are provided on the [PolarityIO GitHub Page](https://polarityio.github.io/).

In addition to installing the integration on the server you will need to configure your Salesforce instance.

### Salesforce Configuration Steps

#### Add a Connected App

Before you can use the Polarity Salesforce Integration you will need to setup a Connected App in your salesforce
instance so Polarity can connect to it.  You can do this by navigating to `Setup` -> `Apps` -> `App Manager` and then
click on the `New Connected App` button.

Fill in the `Basic Information` section

Make sure to check the box next to `Enable OAuth Settings`.

Under `Enable OAuth Settings` you should add `Access and manage your data (api)` as the `Selected OAuth Scope`

Finally check `Require Secret for Web Service Flow`

No other options need to be set.  Save your Connected App.

#### Add Network Access for the Polarity Server

Next you should add the polarity server to your list of trusted IP ranges.  To do this navigate to
`Setup` -> `Security` -> `Network Access`.

Click on the `New` button and add the external IP address for your Polarity Server:

Add the external IP address of your Polarity Server to the `Trusted IP Range`.

Once complete you can begin to configure the Salesforce options from within Polarity.
